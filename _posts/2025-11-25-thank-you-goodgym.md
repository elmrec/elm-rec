A big thank you to [Good Gym](https://www.goodgym.org) for their amazing work! 

Over three evenings in the past three months, volunteers cleared debris, weeds, drains, and even a stinging nettle patch in the children's playground.

## The Results
A cleaner, safer, and more welcoming play space for all the children who enjoy the park.
