What a wonderful morning! Around 35 people from our local community came together to transform Elm Road Recreation Ground with a spectacular display of spring bulbs.

## A Community Effort

On Saturday, November 23rd, our community showed what can be achieved when we work together. Armed with trowels, enthusiasm, and a shared vision for a more beautiful park, volunteers of all ages planted approximately **1000 bulbs** across the recreation ground.

## A Rainbow of Spring Colour

The variety of bulbs planted will create a stunning display come spring:
- Daffodils
- Crocus
- Tulips
- Allium
- Ixia
- Iris
- Muscari

Imagine the park bursting with colour in just a few months - it's going to be absolutely beautiful!

## Supporting the Park

We're thrilled to announce that the event raised **£75**, which will go towards the renovation of the murals in the park area. Every contribution helps us continue improving our shared green space.

## Looking Ahead

As winter settles in, those 1000 bulbs are quietly preparing to burst into life. Come spring, the fruits of today's labour will be on display for everyone to enjoy.

## Thank You

This event wouldn't have been possible without the generosity of our community members who donated bulbs and funds . 

Together, we're making Elm Road Recreation Ground a place we can all be proud of! 🌷🌸🌼

**Special thanks to [Olgardens](https://www.olgardens.co.uk)** for their generous donation of daffodil bulbs. Their support has helped us create what will be a spectacular spring display.
