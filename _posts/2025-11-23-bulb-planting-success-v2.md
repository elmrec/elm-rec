## Bulb Planting 
Around 35 people from our local community came to help with our bulb planting  session on 23rd November.

We planted around 1000 bulbs across the  recreation ground - a mixture of daffodils, crocus, tulips, allium, ixia, iris and muscari - all of which should make our park  look stunning in the spring.

With many thanks  to everyone who donated bulbs or funds. Special thanks to Olgardens (www.olgardens.co.uk) for the donation of daffodil bulbs.

We raised a total of £75 which will  go towards the renovation of the murals in the park area.
