## Special Thanks

We'd like to extend a special thank you to some of our outstanding volunteers **Nick**, **Katherine** and **Louis** for coordinating the bulb planting areas, organizing the litter picking, leading the environmental awareness discussion and inspiring our community

## What We Achieved

- Planted hundreds of spring bulbs that will bring color to our park
- Collected several bags of litter, making our park cleaner and safer
- Strengthened our community bonds through teamwork
- Raised awareness about local environmental care

## Looking Forward

The bulbs we planted together will bloom in spring, serving as a beautiful reminder of what we can achieve when we work together as a community. Keep an eye on our website for future events and opportunities to get involved.

Thank you again to all participants - your dedication to improving our local environment is truly inspiring! üå∑üå±‚ôªÔ∏è
